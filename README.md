Iris Dataset Analysis

This project involves analyzing the Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset in machine learning and data science. It includes data about different species of Iris flowers, including measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

 Libraries Used

* **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **seaborn**: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
* **sklearn.datasets**: To load the Iris dataset.

 Tasks Performed

 Data Loading and Exploration

* **Loaded the Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.
* **Inspected the first few rows** of the dataset to understand its structure.
* **Checked the data types** of each column and for any missing values in the dataset.
* **Cleaned the dataset** by removing rows with missing values (if any).

### 2. Basic Data Analysis

* **Calculated basic statistics** for the numerical columns such as mean, median, and standard deviation using `.describe()`.
* **Grouped the data by species** and computed the mean for each numeric feature (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
* **Observation**: The species `Iris-virginica` has the highest average petal length and petal width among the three species.

Data Visualization

* **Line Chart**: A line chart visualizing the trend of Sepal Length across the dataset.
* **Bar Chart**: A bar chart comparing the average petal length for each species.
* **Histogram**: A histogram showing the distribution of sepal width.
* **Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot to visualize the relationship between sepal length and petal length, colored by species.

Visualizations

1. **Line Chart**: Shows how the sepal length changes across the data points.
2. **Bar Chart**: Compares the average petal length across the three Iris species.
3. **Histogram**: Displays the distribution of sepal width.
4. **Scatter Plot**: Visualizes the relationship between sepal length and petal length for each species.

Data Inspection

* **Data Types**: The dataset includes numeric columns for flower measurements and a categorical column for the species.
* **Missing Values**: No missing values were found after inspecting the dataset. Any missing data would have been dropped in the cleaning step.

 How to Run

To run the analysis, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Then, simply run the Python script containing the code, and it will load the dataset, perform analysis, and display the visualizations.
